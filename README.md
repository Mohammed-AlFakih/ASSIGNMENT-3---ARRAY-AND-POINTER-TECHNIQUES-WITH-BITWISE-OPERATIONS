# ARRAY-AND-POINTER-TECHNIQUES-WITH-BITWISE-OPERATIONS

C code using arrays and pointer techniques with bitwise operations. The challenge of this assignment was to swap 2 values using XOR in C language. However, XOR operations does not
support floating numbers and only accepts integers, and that was the challenge, to find a solution while using XOR operation to swap numbers! Lines: 449-477 explains my way to solve this issue.
